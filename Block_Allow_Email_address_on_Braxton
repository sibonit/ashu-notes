If a user requests to have a particular email address sent to spam, here's how you do it. 
In this example below, we will add an email address to spam in Govindjee's email account.

1. >ssh to Braxton
2. >sudo bash
3. >cd home/gov     #Govindjee's folder
4. >gvim .procmailrc
5. Now edit this file to add or remove the email address.
