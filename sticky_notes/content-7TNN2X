Since you're teaching it, it will work for you right away.
 If I do it for you it would stop me half way and send you
an email to have you finish the remaining steps yourself
anyway.

This is the process you'll use each semester you need to
migrate a past course forward.

Try it out and let me know how it goes.  Don't worry about
doing anything wrong, you can always have ATLAS delete bad
copies or fix any problems if it's not what you want.
