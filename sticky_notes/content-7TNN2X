Moodle details
============

Please use the following instructions to move your old course to the current semester.

1) log into learn.illinois.edu
2) click the [Request a Course Site] on the My Home page
3) choose "This is a request for a course I am teaching"
4) click the gray/white [Learn@Illinois Moodle] button
5) check the box for the first Term and Course you want
6) [Get Sections] and choose Select All sections
7) click "Load material from prior course"
8) select the Fall 2014 copy you want to migrate over
9) continue the process
10) when done, repeat for the other two courses

Since you're teaching it, it will work for you right away.
 If we do it for you it would stop us half way and send you
an email to have you finish the remaining steps yourself
anyway.

This is the process you'll use each semester to migrate a past course forward.

Try it out and let us know how it goes.  Don't worry about
doing anything wrong, you can always have ATLAS delete bad
copies or fix any problems if it's not what you want.
