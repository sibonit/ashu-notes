A quarter century later, a Department of Botany was formally established  and our first  Ph.D. was minted in 1909. Fifty years on, we  uprooted our headquarters from its ancestral home in the Natural History Building and transplanted it across Matthews Street to Morrill Hall where it thrives today. In 1983, we updated our name to Plant Biology.</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  history is not made by dates and buildings. It is made by people: inspired individuals who establish, maintain and grow  traditions and reputations by creating the kind of scholarly and collegial atmosphere that attracts more like themselves. Here we honor the biologists upon whose shoulders the current members of the University of Illinois Plant Biology Department stand.</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is just beginning. Information  missing below will be added as time and resources allow. But our story will always be a work in progress.  Memory of our past and passed colleagues' accomplishments fades all too quickly as we focus on the present and future.

              <p><strong><img src="images/faculty/JonesB&W.jpg" width="80" height="96" hspace="7" align="right" />Almut Jones.</strong> Plant Systematist. Almut received her B.S. degree with high honors in agriculture from the University of Illinois in 1958. She completed her M.S. degree in botany with a minor in agronomy from the UI in 1960. In 1973, Almut received her Ph.D. from the Botany Department at the UI specializing in plant taxonomy with a minor in agronomy. During her career, she held various positions in plant biology, ultimately becoming curator of the UI Herbarium, a position she held until her retirement. Her field of research centered on the plant genus, Aster. She published many papers about the systematics of this large, complicated group of species and was recognized nationally and internationally as an authority on Aster.
