CREATE AUTO JOBS IN UNIX

Scenario: For the microbiology Conference site, once we open the registration, we need to close them on a certain date. You can have a auto job set up for this, to make sure you do not forget to do it.

Site: https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/microbiology/research_conference/

On Grappelli:

> ssh admin@grappelli and sudo bash
> cd /rails/micro_research_conf

Now create a file that contains all the commands that need to run to have the registration closed:

> gvim local/close_registration.sh 

In this file, enter the following commands and save it:

cd /rails/micro_research_conf/app/views/abstracts
rm new.html.erb
ln -s registration_closed.html.erb new.html.erb
touch /rails/micro_research_conf/tmp/restart.txt

Run the below command to activate the job:
 > at -f /rails/micro_research_conf/local/close_registration.sh 12:00 AM October 2 2015

The above command, will set the system to run the close_registation.sh file to run on the date/time you provided. When the file executes on the set date, it will do the following:
	- runs the codes inside the file
	- remove the symlink for new.html.erb to registration_open.html.erb
	- create new symlink for new.html.erb to registration_closed.html.erb
	- Restart server
